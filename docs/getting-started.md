# Install and sign in

xatc-agent has two parts. The controller runs in the cloud. On your sim PC you run a small program, the **client**, in its own window beside X-Plane. It reads your aircraft's state from X-Plane, sends your voice while you hold push-to-talk, and plays ATC's replies through a radio effect.

## What you need

| | |
|---|---|
| Simulator | X-Plane 12 (12.1.4 or newer is best: the window's radio swap button then uses X-Plane's own swap command) |
| PC | Windows 10 or 11. The window uses Edge WebView2, which ships with both |
| Audio | A microphone, and speakers or a headset |
| Account | An xatc-agent account, created for you by the project owner |
| The client | The client package, also from the owner, with the **gateway address** to paste into Settings |
| Phone | An authenticator app, for the sign-in's second step |

!!! note "Invitation only"
    xatc-agent is an experiment and is not open for sign-up. If you were invited, the owner has sent you the client, the gateway address and an email with a temporary password.

## Install (one time)

1. Unzip the client package on the sim PC, anywhere you like.
2. Open PowerShell in that folder and run:

    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\setup-windows.ps1
    ```

    The script checks for [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (it shows the official install command and asks before running it), installs Python and the client, and runs a quick self-check: the window engine, your audio devices, and whether a sign-in is already saved. It makes no network call.

3. Allow the microphone: *Windows Settings > Privacy & security > Microphone > Let desktop apps access your microphone*.

There is nothing else to install and no keys to copy. You sign in from the window.

## Start the client

Double-click **`scripts\xatc-agent-client-run.cmd`**. A console window shows warnings and errors, and the **xatc-agent** window opens with the startup dialog: one row each for your sign-in, the ATC gateway and X-Plane.

- X-Plane is shown but not required yet. Start it whenever you like; the client keeps looking for it.
- Only one client runs at a time. If a second one says it cannot start, use the window that is already open.

## Sign in

1. Press **Sign in** in the startup dialog. Your browser opens the xatc-agent sign-in page.
2. The first time, enter your email and the temporary password from your invitation, choose your own password, and set up your authenticator app. After that it is your email, your password and the authenticator's code (or a passkey, if you add one).
3. The browser says **Signed in** and you can close the tab. The window's sign-in pill turns green.

You stay signed in for 30 days, across restarts. In the last 24 hours the window offers **Sign in again**, which never interrupts a flight. The client keeps your sign-in in Windows Credential Manager, never in a file.

## Tell the client where ATC is

The first time, the startup dialog's gateway row says it needs setting up:

1. Press **Open Settings**.
2. Paste the gateway address the owner gave you into **Runtime ARN**.
3. Under **Audio**, pick your microphone and your speakers or headset.
4. Press **Save**.

That is all the setup. [Settings](settings.md) describes everything else you can change, such as push-to-talk on a yoke button and how the controllers sound.

## The recording question

The first time you connect, the window asks one thing before you can transmit:

> **Keep your radio audio to improve xatc?** xatc can keep recordings of what you say on the radio, to train it to understand pilots better. Only your own transmissions are kept, in private storage, for 180 days. The owner and the ATC expert can listen to them. You can change this at any time in Settings. Nothing is kept unless you allow it.

Choose **Allow** or **Don't allow**. Your choice is remembered with your account, and you can change it in **Settings > Audio**. [Your data](privacy.md) says what else is sent and kept.
